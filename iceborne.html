            Monster Hunter World: Iceborne Review
        </h1>
        <br> The line between an expansion and a full-blown sequel is one Monster Hunter World: Iceborne comes close to blurring into oblivion. While this is not an entirely new game in feel or structure when compared to Monster Hunter: World, it adds
        a new story nearly as large as the base game’s with almost as many new monsters to kill, carve, and wear like a celebratory tuxedo. Couple that with innumerable quality-of-life improvements (plus a few exciting surprises along the way) and Iceborne
        manages to hit the high bar set by Monster Hunter: World no matter what you call it. The story this time around is just as amusing and inconsequential as the original: monsters are behaving erratically, a dangerous new elder dragon has appeared,
        and an exciting snow-covered land unlike any of the others has been discovered. Just like last time, you follow tracks, fight monsters, and try to figure out what’s causing all this commotion so you can promptly kill it and turn it into a sweet
        pair of pants – you know, for research.
        <br>
        <br> While the story is (once again) pretty much just there to pull you through the bulk of the new content, Iceborne adds a welcome new emphasis on its cast. The excellent cutscene quality you already know is back, but now with more of a spotlight
        on existing side characters like the Tracker and the Field Team Leader (which does make it a little funny that they still don’t have real names). Without spoilers, these characters have actual story arcs this time – they’re still pretty shallow,
        but it made the story more engaging and far less forgettable than the first.
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2>
            Out With the Old Gear, In With the New
        </h2>
        <br> But let’s get into the meat and potatoes of Iceborne: the gear. This expansion picks up after the end of the base game’s main campaign, but I was curious how it would tempt me away from my High Rank armor and weapons, which were full of augments
        and synergistic skills I’d grown so used to. It turns out the answer is by looking you square in the eye and saying, “That fancy augmented Gamma armor you like so much? Yeah, it’s trash now.” I’m exaggerating here... but not by much. Here’s a
        quick comparison for context: a typical piece of World’s best High Rank armor will give you 72 defense, which can then be bumped up to 92 if you augment and upgrade it to the max. Enter Iceborne’s all-new Master Rank missions with an entirely
        new tier of equipment where Bone and Alloy Armor – the bottom-of-the-barrel basic stuff – has a whopping 114 base defense. Master Rank gear offers a jump in power that truly leaves High Rank in the dust.
        <br> And, just so it’s clear, that’s the worst armor in Iceborne. I was able to stubbornly hold onto the High Rank armor I’d worked so hard to get for the first half-dozen quests or so, but when I finally decided to upgrade my total defense jumped
        more than 300 points in a single trip to the forge. Crucially, while it made me sad to leave my lovely Xeno’Jiiva wings behind, this reset was far more exciting than frustrating. It didn’t really feel like it was devaluing what I had earned in
        the base game because I was just too dang excited about what I was getting in return. The loot chase is fully reinvigorated. In addition to the higher stats, new skill combinations to experiment with, and cool new armor aesthetics (most of which
        are fantastic, though some do look disappointingly identical to their High Rank counterparts), you’re also getting the new level 4 Decoration slots. One of these is on every piece of Beta armor, allowing you to easily use powerful new Decorations
        that can come with two different skills in one. This helps any Master Rank armor set offer more than just a numerical draw.
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2>
            A Wider World
        </h2>
        <br> While the snowy new location called the Hoarfrost Reach is the focal point of Iceborne, only about half (at most) of the campaign is spent there. You’ll return to the mainland of the New World a fair amount, but there’s actually a great balance
        struck between exploring this beautiful new playground and facing fresh threats in familiar places. It keeps that winter wonderland from ever getting dull, though it was never at much risk of that to begin with. While the constant need for Hot
        Drinks and the slow pace of moving through heavily snowy areas can be tedious at times, the Hoarfrost Reach is a fantastic addition to World. The different sections of its map feel varied and exciting, from icy caverns to hot springs to snowy
        fields to acid-filled underground lairs. My favorite spot was a frozen cliff face where whole sections of the ground can come crumbling down, dropping you to an underground area far away if you don’t escape to stable footing in time.
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2>
            Verdict
        </h2>
        <br> A true beast of an expansion, Monster Hunter World: Iceborne adds a boatload of impressive new and returning monsters and improvements to an already incredible game. It’s almost big enough to be a sequel in terms of the sheer amount of content
        it adds – even if it leans a little bit too heavily on Subspecies and Variants of familiar monsters at times (though that’s an issue veteran fans may not be bothered by as much). Iceborne is exciting and creative throughout, reiterating Monster
        Hunter: World’s place as one of the very best games of this generation.

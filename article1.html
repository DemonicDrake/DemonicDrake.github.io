        The update also brings the new Mii fighters - Altair from Assassin's Creed, a Rabbid, Mega Man X, MegaMan.exe, and Cuphead - to Smash Ultimate, as well as the ability to pre-purchase the Fighters Pass Vol 2, which will add 6 more fighters to the already
        massive roster. Byleth has low mobility, but they are a "distance demon," according to game director Masahiro Sakurai. Byleth can use the Hero Relics, including the Sword of the Creator, the Areadbhar lance, the Aymr axe, and the Failnaught bow.
        Byleth's Final Smash is Progenitor God Final Heaven, and he/she will team up with Sothis for a powerful attack.
